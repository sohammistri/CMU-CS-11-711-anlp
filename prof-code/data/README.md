# Advanced NLP Data

This contains several example data sets:

## sst-sentiment-text-fiveclass

Textual data from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank: http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html
The classes are the original 5 classes.

## sst-sentiment-text-threeclass

Textual data from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank: http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html
The classes collapse the two positive and negative classes from the original treebank to a single class, so there are three classes: "positive" (1), "negative" (-1), and "neutral" (0).

## ptb-text

Textual data from Tomas Mikolov's processed version of the Penn Treebank: https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1085.9149&rep=rep1&type=pdf
